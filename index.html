            It's important to discuss your decision to become an organ donor
            with your family and loved ones. This
            will ensure that they are aware of your wishes and can make
            decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do
            so.

            If you pass away in a way that allows for organ donation, medical
            professionals will determine if your
            organs are eligible for donation. This will be based on a number of
            factors, including the cause of death,
            your medical history, and the condition of your organs.
